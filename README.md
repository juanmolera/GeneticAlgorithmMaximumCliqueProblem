<h3>Genetic Algorithm for the Maximum Clique Problem</h3>

This repository contains an evolutive algorithm capable of solving the maximun clique problem for all the instances. It proposes 2 different approaches for the objective function: fixed or adaptative weighted. There are different configuration files for each objective function, respectively: 1a.txt and 1b.txt. <br/>
